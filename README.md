ParrotStore is a project for connecting the Parrot Virtual Machine (PVM) to a
variety of storage mechanisms, including 3rd party storage and persistance
mechanisms, caches, and databases.

ParrotStore requires Parrot, Winxed and Rosella. Make sure you have all these
things built and installed on your system.

The first storage mechanism to be supported is Memcached. Other mechanisms will
be supported in the future.
